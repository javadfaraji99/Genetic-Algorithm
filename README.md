This was a project for AI Course in University. The subject is Genetic Algorithms.

Part 1) <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to cluster the [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) dataset by genetic algorithm and find the best clusters through each generation. I tried it with different number of clusters
and plot the results. you can know more about in the documatation and report.

Part 2) <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this part, I solved the Traveling Salesman Problem ([TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)) which is a famous problem in Computer Science world using Genetic 
Algorithm. I explained the details in my report.
